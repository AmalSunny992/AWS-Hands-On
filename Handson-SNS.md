## Additional Features

#### 1. **Using SNS with AWS Lambda**
   - You can trigger AWS Lambda functions in response to messages published to an SNS topic. To do this, create a new subscription with the protocol set to "AWS Lambda" and enter the ARN of your Lambda function.

#### 2. **Using SNS with Amazon SQS**
   - You can use SNS to fan out messages to multiple SQS queues. Create a new subscription with the protocol set to "Amazon SQS" and enter the ARN of your SQS queue.

#### 3. **SMS Notifications**
   - SNS can send SMS messages to phone numbers. Create a new subscription with the protocol set to "SMS" and enter the phone number.

#### 4. **Message Filtering**
   - You can use message filtering to selectively send messages to subscribers based on message attributes. This is useful for implementing fine-grained control over message delivery.
